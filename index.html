          » Olive oil as a liquid fat is not desirable for baking, unless it is specifically called for,
          because it is very flavorful and can be off putting.<br><br>» All solid fats can be substituted for liquid fats by melting them first,
          however keep in mind that because the fat will solidify when cooled it will create slightly different final results.</i></div></div>

          Fat is indispensable in baking. It is what makes baked goods tender and moist,
          but it also plays some more scientific roles in how our baked goods rise.
          We talk about the categories of fats, how they function differently and all of the roles of fats in baking.

        <h1 div class="h1left">FUNCTION OF FAT IN BAKING</div></h1>
        <hr width="8%" size="1" color="#f3f7e4" align="left"/>
        <br>
        <h1 div class="h1left" style="color: #d4cc61;">RICHNESS, FLAVOR, AND MOISTURE</div></h1>
        <p style="width:60%">The primary role of fat in baking is to give flavor, richness and moisture to baked goods.
          Baked goods with a lot of fat have a more luxurious feel in the mouth and they generally taste better.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 div class="h1left" style="color: #d4cc61;">CREATES TENDERNESS</div></h1>
        <p style="width:60%">Fat is a powerful tenderizer in baking. It serves to coat flour to act as a barrier between the proteins and water,
          thereby slowing down gluten development. <br><br> Furthermore, fat actually works to shorten gluten strands.
          This is why something like a cinnamon roll, which is a yeast bread made with fat is much more tender than a baguette,
          which is a yeast bread madw without fat.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h1 div class="h1left" style="color: #d4cc61;">HELPS WITH LEAVENING</div></h1>
        <p style="width:60%">Fat also plays a vital role in leavening baked goods. When solid fat is creamed with sugar it supports the web of air
          that is beaten into the two ingredients which lifts and leavens our baked goods. <br><br> Butter also contains a percentage of water that evaporates off when it is baked,
          creating lift. This is seen very evidently when making puff pastry, for example, croissants. Puff pastry is made by folding the pastry in a way that creates alternating layers
          of dough and butter in a process called lamination, and the layers of butter do all of the leavening in the pastry.

        <h1 div class="h1left">TYPES OF FAT</div></h1>
        <hr width="8%" size="1" color="#f3f7e4" align="left"/>
        <p style="width:60%">The types of fats used in baking can be categorized into two: <em>Liquid fats</em> and <em>solid fats</em>. <a div visited href="recipe.html">
          <u>This banana bread recipe uses both types of fats.</u></div></a>
          <br><br>Solid fats can always be melted into liquid fat form, but they do re-solidify when cooled so they function slightly differently that true liquid fats.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h1 div class="h1left" style="color: #d4cc61;">TYPES OF SOLID FATS</div></h1>
        <p style="width:60%">There are 3 main types of solid fats used in baking: <b>Butter</b>, <b>vegetable shortening</b>, and <b>lard</b>.
          <b>Coconut oil</b> is also a solid fat that is gaining popularity in baking.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h1 div class="h1left" style="color: #d4cc61;">TYPES OF LIQUID FATS</div></h1>
        <p style="width:60%">All of your oils are liquid fats. For baking, you want to use a neutral flavored oil like canola oil, vegetable oil, or grapeseed oil.
          <br><br>All oils function the same in baking as they are 100% fat. The main function of liquid fats (oils) in baking is to add richness and tenderness,
          and because they do not solidify when cooled, they create baked goods that are more tender that baked goods made with solid fats.
          <br><br>Oils cannot help with leavening, because they do not become solid, and therefore are typically not a good substitute for solid fats.
