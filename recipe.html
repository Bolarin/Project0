        <h1 div class="h1left">Mashing Your Bananas</h1>
        <hr width="12%" size="1" color="#f3f7e4" align="left"/>
        <p style="width:98%;"> The easiest way to go about this is by mashing with a fork or a potato masher.
          But the best way to go about it (if possible) is to go a step further from mashing, by tossing the mashed bananas into a blender and giving it a pulse or two.
          This makes for a smoother loaf. But if you prefer your bread textured with bits of bananas, then go ahead and ditch the blender.</p>


        <h1 div class="h1left">Instructions</h1>
        <hr width="8%" size="1" color="#f3f7e4" align="left"/>

      <ol style="width:70%;">
          <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Coat a 9x5-inch loaf pan with butter, oil or nonstick spray. Set aside.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Using a wooden spoon (or an electric mixer), beat the butter and sugar until very well combined. Add in the eggs, one at a time, and continue mixing.
              <br><br>Add in the yogurt, mashed bananas, vanilla and/or condensed milk extracts and mix until well combined. <br><br>
              Next, pour in the dry ingredients and mix well. Do not overmix. If using the nuts and/or chocolate chips, now gently fold them in.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 50-60 minutes.
              Check by inserting a toothpick in the center of the loaf, if it comes out clean, your bread is ready. <br><br>
              Remove the pan from the oven and allow the bread to cool in the pan until the pan is warm to the touch.
              Remove the bread from the pan and set on a wire rack to continue cooling.</li>
          <br>
          <li>You can top and garnish as desired.</li>
          <br>
          </ol>
